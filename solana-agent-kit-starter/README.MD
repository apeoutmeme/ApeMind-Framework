# Efficient Package Management with pnpm

## Why Choose `pnpm`?

### 1. Disk-Space Efficiency
- `pnpm` is more disk-space efficient compared to `npm` or `yarn`.
- It creates a **single storage** for all package versions across projects, reducing duplication.

### 2. Faster Installation Times
- Enjoy faster dependency installation times compared to `npm`.
